Ideas for validating and comaaring evacuation models. 

1. Basic models to compare to:
        - random evacuation
        - greedy evacuation
        - parametrized rule-based evacuation (to define)

2. Experiments to validate behaviors of models:
        - In a very simple grid, with a single fire cell, the agent should move away from the fire cell.

3. Metrics to compare models:
        - Average final reward over multiple runs (for a given map?)
        - ?
