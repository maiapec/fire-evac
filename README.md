# fire-evac
**Optimizing evacuation routes and directions for individuals facing wildfire propagation**

This project builds upon the PyroRL environment, https://github.com/sisl/PyroRL.git.

We investigate three reinforcement learning algorithms for dyanmic wildfire evacuation of a single agent:
- Monte-Carlo Tree Search
- Offline Q-learning
- Deep Q-Networks

These methods are compared to two baseline heuristics: (1) taking random actions, and (2) maximizing the immediate distance to the fire.

Examples of implementation can be found in the folder fire-evac/gifs.
